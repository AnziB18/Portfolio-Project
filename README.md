## General Information

In this project, I’ll build a webpage to show my different Projects. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

In this project, my homepage will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!

This project is part of a project during my education on #Codecemy!

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 - version 2021
* CSS3
* Visual Studio Code

## Project Status

* Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:

* Improvement - no Improvements now

To do:

I am going to build a homepage to show my projects. I'll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but at least it should include:

    * Build a website using HTML, CSS
    * Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript 
    * Use Git version control
    * Use the command line and file navigation
    * Develop locally on your computer
    * Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages

1. Plan Your Project
Visualize my end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all the project objectives.
Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

2. Wireframe your website
Using my Wireframe standard html to draft what my portfolio to look like.
Think about what the main components of the site will be and how I would like to see them arranged on the page. Since I will be building multiple pages, make sure to create wireframes for each page.
Main components that you will want to include:
    * A main header
    * Navigation to take you to all the pages on your site
    * A picture and title for each project

3. Create files and deploy it Locally
I create a directory to hold my files and create each file. Deploy my code locally to see what it looks like in the browser.
Create an index.html, style.css, and script.js files. If I am creating additional pages, make sure to add additional .html files to represent that content. Using the VSCode text editor, write a few lines of HTML code (this does not need to be the start of your project, but it can be if I’d like.) Deploy my code locally by clicking on the index.html file and viewing it in the browser. I’ll want to do this continuously as you work on your project.

4. Version control
Set up Git tracking in my directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

5. Build the Home Page
The home page will be the main page that users visit. It should prominently feature my name, along with a selection of several projects that I am most proud of. Each project should have a picture, a summary of the project, and the technology used to build it.
Make sure to use your knowledge of semantic HTML

6. Build the Contact Page
The contact page includes my email address, as well as any other relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

7. Style the content
Now I consider how you would like it to look and how to arrange my projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical arrangement? What colors do I want to use to personalize the page?
Use your knowledge of display and positioning, Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to arrange the content on the page.

8. Make it interactive
Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website.
I can use JavaScript in any number of ways. Some possibilities are:

    * Change the style of a photo when someone clicks on it.
    * Enable dropdown menus
    * Let users toggle between light and dark mode

9. Make it responsive
Use responsive design to ensure that my page is viewable on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Use media queries to resize my images when necessary. Consider using different grid arrangements to change the design of your page depending on the device.

10. Publish to the web
Take what I’ve built and use GitHub pages to share with the world.
Import my local Git repository to GitHub and enable GitHub pages in the repository settings. Make sure to upload the directory with your index.html file to this repository. You can edit the README.md file with an explanation on your project.

If you want, you can tour our [example site]( https://priceless-kepler-06d70c.netlify.app/) for inspiration or to see how we made a Project Portfolio homepage.
