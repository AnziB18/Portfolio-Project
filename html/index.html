                <p>
                    Hy! My name is Bernd and I am a <span>45</span> years old student from Codecadmy!<br> <!-- later put in JS into span -->
                    I have two wonderfull sons which are <span>17</span> and <span>18</span> years old.<br><!-- later put in JS into span -->
                    I studied chemistry when I was young and many years I worked in this field.<br>
                    I always liked working with Excel-Sheets or with Datas. And I really like to drive fast cars.

                <h3 class="center">Why I started with Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    It was pure luck that I started with coding, because I never though about this as a career posiibility for me.<br>
                    I was interested in Forex Trading and started to look about trading roboter and started with my first code in a computer language called mql4<br>
                    It was so amazing, how fast time run by when I started with coding. Every problem I faced of, trigged more interest for coding.
                    After two years I started with Codecademy and I hope very soon I will finish the FullStack Course
                </p>
                <h3 class="center">My Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    To get a job in the field of a Full Stack Developer / or related to this edcuation!
